### **Abstract**  
New Worlds Reading AR Expeditions is an educational Augmented Reality (AR) video game designed to enhance literacy in 3rd- to 5th-grade students through interactive, immersive experiences. By integrating AI tools at every stage of developmentâ€”from brainstorming and concept art to programming and gameplayâ€”we demonstrate the transformative  potential of AI-driven design in educational technologies. AI-enhanced tools powered the rapid generation of creative ideas, streamlined art and music asset creation, automated game scripting, and provided multilingual voiceovers and translations to reach diverse student audiences. Moreover, these AI-driven methodologies effectively address common  challenges in software and game development, such as overcoming design bottlenecks, reducing resource-intensive asset production, and simplifying complex debugging processes. Dynamic gameplay is supported by AI-driven behavior trees, allowing creatures to exhibit realistic interactions and respond to player decisions. This project exemplifies how the integration of AI and AR technologies can create engaging, personalized learning environments to enhance literacy outcomes through fun games. The collaboration between the UF College of Education and technical teams further underscores the critical role of interdisciplinary innovation in shaping the future of learning.

The University of Florida College of Education and Lastinger Center for Learning are exploring how Augmented Reality technology can inspire kids to engage with more books while developing solutions for young learners statewide. Designed to boost reading motivation for 3rd to 5th grade students in Florida who are reading below grade level, AR Expeditions is an application that transforms a paper book into an immersive experience. Students explore exciting environments, interact with educational content, and foster a love for reading. AR Expeditions builds confidence and motivates children to build a deeper connection to literacy. The app is slated to launch on iOS and Android in Spring 2025 with the Ocean AR experience, and will be periodically updated to include additional experiences in the future. New Worlds Reading AR will be published by University of Florida on both Google Play and Apple App Store, built for phones and tablet devices.
